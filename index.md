## Who are we?

Muses Code JS run free JavaScript and Node.js workshops for women, non-binary and trans folk around Australia to diversify the tech community.

At Muses, we believe that everyone should try coding at least once in their life. Therefore, we've created a community where, in a friendly atmosphere with a great vibe, people can try programming for the first time or if they already code - learn something new about JavaScript and/or Node.js.

We run half day coding boot camps that offer great opportunities for our attendees to grow their network and meet new people with similar interests.

As a mentor, attendees have the opportunity to not only learn from you, but also ask someone in the tech world about what the industry and your job is like - so let them tap into the knowledge and experience you bring to table!

## What is this?

This manual is a set of useful tips and tricks that Muses Code JS mentors can use.

Mentoring is an amazing skill for professional development and a fantastic way to give back to the community. Being a mentor is a challenging but rewarding task and thus we have collected together all the things we have learned during the workshops so far to share with you.

## What do I need to be a mentor?

Your interest in helping beginners dip their toes into web development is already a great start! You don't need to be an expert in programming or JavaScript - we're teaching pretty basic stuff. You only need:

- Lots of patience, smiles and a friendly attitude
- The ability to answer all sorts of questions in a beginner-friendly way (even if that means the explanation isn’t technically precise) throughout the duration of the workshop
- Time to go through the [Intro to JavaScript](https://github.com/muses-code-js/js-intro-workshop) tutorial before the event
- Free time on the weekend
- Curiosity!

## How can I apply to be a mentor?

To become a Muses Code JS mentor all you need to do is:

- Go to the [Muses Code JS](www.musescodejs.org) website and look for an event you can help with
- Fill in the mentor application form on the event website

Alternatively you can drop us a line at <a href="mailto:info@musescodejs.org">info@musescodejs.org</a> and ask about upcoming events.

## Why should I mentor?

You mean besides incredibly good karma? Here are some very likely outcomes:

- You’ll meet interesting new people outside your usual developer group
- You’ll probably learn something new by answering questions you never thought of asking yourself
- Eternal gratitude from your group of attendees and the Muses Code JS community
- You’ll help break down the stereotype that women are not interested in technology and programming and thus help your sisters, female friends, relatives and (future) daughters have more choices in their future. And you can add all that on your CV!
