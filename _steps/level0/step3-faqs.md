Frequently asked questions from mentors! If in doubt, ping the mentor channels on Slack for any other not-so-frequently asked questions.

### I don’t think I can come for a full day workshop as I have other plans - is it ok?

Yes, you can come for a few hours to help us up. Morning time is busiest. Let us know from what time until what time you plan to stay.

### I am a beginner and I don’t know much, I don’t think I am ready to be a mentor.

We hold workshops for all levels of programming skills and we always have complete beginners on the day. You are in a great position to explain many things to such people.

If you do some coding, you already can help for those who never coded before - and most likely be inspirational to them!

Further in this guide, you'll find links to the workshop and you can walk through it to prepare, we also will have support for you to mentor on the day if needed. Remember, everyone is there to learn and we have a safe and relaxed environment for trying mentoring AND coding for the first, second or upteenth time! :)

### How should I prepare for the event to be a mentor?

Here you'll find links for workshops that will run on the event. However, some workshops do not have a full guide so we will provide a list of concepts/tools that will be used in that workshop.

It will help you to prepare. We also will have either creator of a workshop or one of our techie members on the prep session for mentors, where they will be able to answer your questions.

### Can I bring my wife, kid, husband to the workshop?

Yes, they should register/get a ticket for the event as attendee (for a small kid write +1 next to your or your partner name on registration).

### Is it a female only event?

No, but as we do try to support women we normally ask our male attendees to bring female attendee with them. It is not related to mentors but still would be great :)

### I feel confident in the technical aspect, but I never mentored before, how I will know what to do?

We will hold info/prep session before the event for mentors, walking through mentor’s etiquette, agenda of the day and content. Also, feel free to ask questions to our mentor coordinator.
